# Node.js: Securing RESTful APIs

APIs are a crucial business driver for delivering data to your applications. In this course, learn about various options for securing your RESTful API that can help you keep your application data—and your users—safe. Instructor Emmanuel Henri begins the course with an overview of top security threats and an introduction to the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), an important resource on security. He then steps through how to set up and secure a Node and Express API, including how to add handlers for registration and login, finalize secured endpoints, and test your finalized API. To wrap up, he shares a few alternatives for securing APIs.
